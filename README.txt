Questions for 2/6/23: 

What does each hypotheses mean for the growth (linear vs. nonlinear) in low concentration situation? What does it mean for high concentration? 
  For high concentration, do both hypotheses predict the production leveling off due to flow rate? 
  The difference between the two patterns at high and low concentration forms the contrast between the two hypotheses
  

For b_q2 is MSE a good enough way to say the linear function fits well only for the middle bit

What's the difference between Residual Standard Error and Mean Standard Error

For the taylor expansion, what's the justification for not going beyond second term?

a_q6: the behavior is exponential decay. But what is decaying? 
decrease rate of accumulation bc rate of production equalizes the rate of losss through flow rate. 

remaining question: S being not a linear function of t?
