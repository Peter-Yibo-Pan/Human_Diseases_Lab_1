Lab 1: Bacteria's Brain
Name: Peter Yibo Pan

This folder includes the assignment in two formats: as .html and .docx file. While .docx is more traditional for submitting assignment, I find the html format to have much better presentation of figures. The HTML file will also serve as my submission of raw code since the code is not included in .docx file. 

The folder also includes a subfolder "figures" which includes the seven graphs generated by the code. 

Apologies for the complication as I am unable to submit everything required by this assignment in one single file. 

The entirety of the assignment can also be found at:

The code should be completely reproducible.
